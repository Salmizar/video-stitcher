# Video Stitcher
Finding a solution to stitch 2 videos together with no watermark (free of charge) doesn't seem to exist. Also the ability to trim the original videos before saving is a must have feature. So I decided to make my own solution to this problem, while learning Svelte.

The solution is a simple to use SPA that will stitch 2 videos together with no watermark. Supports the ability to trim videos before stitching.

Requirements, UI/UX design files can be found in:

# Demo, run locally

I will not be hosting a demo of this application due to the CPU requirements of FF-MPEG. See [Backend](https://github.com/Salmizar/video-stitcher/blob/main/backend/README.md) and [client](https://github.com/Salmizar/video-stitcher/blob/main/client/README.md) README.md files for instructions on how to run locally.
