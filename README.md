# Video Stitcher
Finding a solution to stitch 2 videos together with no watermark (free of charge) doesn't seem to exist. Also the ability to trim the original videos before saving is a feature I need before stitching them. So I decided to make my own solution to this problem, while learning Svelte.

The solution is a simple to use SPA that will stitch 2 videos together with no watermark. Supports the ability to trim videos before stitching.
